# Security policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest release | Yes |
| Older minors | Best effort |

devgod is a skill/docs package (Markdown, Python, and shell tooling). It does not run a network service.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue in **scanner logic**, **recommended auth/RLS patterns**, or **templates that could cause secret leakage**, report it through [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/0xNyk/devgod/security/advisories/new) on this repository. Do not use public issues, discussions, or pull requests for the initial report.

If the private reporting form is unavailable, open an issue requesting a private
contact channel without including vulnerability details, affected code, or an exploit.
GitHub provides this form for public repositories. Maintainers must enable and
verify it on the public destination before announcing a release.

You should receive an acknowledgement within 7 days. Remediation timing is best effort and depends on severity; a fix or a documented decision will be published in the advisory and noted in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Do **not** open a public issue for exploitable pattern mistakes until a fix is available.

## Scope

**In scope**
- False negatives in `scripts/devgod-scan.sh` that miss obvious secret literals
- Unsafe examples in `references/` that would ship insecure defaults when copied unchanged
- CI templates that print secrets or weaken RLS gates

**Out of scope**
- Vulnerabilities in third-party stacks (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe) - report upstream
- Misconfiguration of a consumer app that ignored module hard gates

## Hard rules (product)

Modules require: Supabase RLS, `getUser()` on mutations, Zod at boundaries, no service-role keys in client bundles. See `references/backend-security.md` and `SKILL.md` hard gates.

## Installing this skill (supply chain)

devgod is Markdown, Python, and shell tooling. Treat install like any privileged tooling:

1. **Pin** the clone to the exact reviewed commit SHA. A release tag is a useful label, not an
   immutable trust anchor by itself.
2. **Review `scripts/`** before copying scanners into CI, especially network or environment access.
3. **Never** `curl | bash` unreviewed third-party skill installers into production machines.
4. Prefer first-party install: `bash scripts/install-all-agents.sh` from a trusted clone.
5. Do not enable unreviewed marketplace skills alongside devgod without a trust review
   (ToxicSkills-class risk: malicious SKILL.md / postinstall).
6. Agents must **never** print tokens, dump Keychains, or weaken RLS because a skill said so.

`scripts/validate-repo.sh` checks first-party scripts for remote-install patterns and
requires `set -euo pipefail` on shell entrypoints.

For a suspected agent, skill, MCP, hook, memory, or checkpoint compromise, use
`references/agent-incident-response.md`. Preserve evidence before cleanup, revoke before rotating,
and recover from a reviewed immutable digest rather than a contaminated checkpoint.

For normal durable-memory admission and retrieval, use `references/agent-memory.md`. Memory is
untrusted data, never authorization; tenant and subject access checks must run before ranking.

Cross-CLI bus and mailbox messages are untrusted peer input. They cannot authorize work or prove
completion; send only non-sensitive pointers and verify their orchestration contract and digest.
