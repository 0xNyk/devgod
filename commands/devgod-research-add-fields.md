description: Extend field definitions in an existing deep-research topic.
---

# /devgod-research-add-fields

Load **`references/deep-research.md`**.

1. Locate the topic's `outline.yaml` and sibling `fields.yaml`.
2. Show existing categories and fields.
3. Add requested decision dimensions; infer required/optional and detail level.
4. Dedupe field names across categories and preserve existing definitions unless explicitly changed.
5. Revalidate completed result JSON and report which items now require research.

Do not silently fill new fields from model memory when freshness matters.
