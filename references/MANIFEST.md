# devgod module manifest

**Load on demand** - read only modules needed for the current task.
Do not bulk-load this file or all references at session start.

**Canonical full catalog** (SKILL.md keeps a short high-frequency map only).

**Human documentation**: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) (install, verbs, CI setup - not for agent bulk-load)
