# Agentic engineering research - July 2026

This synthesis favors stable engineering rules over vendor-specific APIs.

## Findings adopted

- Agent quality is a property of the model and harness together. Evaluate end-state outcomes,
  trajectories, tool calls, cost, and latency; run repeated trials because one pass hides variance.
- Context is a finite control surface. Curated checkpoints and minimal relevant context outperform
  indefinite transcript growth for long-running work.
- Long-horizon work needs explicit initialization, incremental progress, persistent artifacts,
  rehydration, and environment-based verification.
- Workflow complexity should earn its place. Deterministic code and single-agent loops are the
  default; multi-agent graphs help when work is separable and coordination is explicit.
- Autonomy needs layered permissions, sandboxing, prompt-injection defenses, idempotent actions,
  failure thresholds, and human escalation for high-risk mutations.
- Capability evals and regression evals serve different jobs. Holdouts, reference solutions,
  balanced positive/negative tasks, calibrated graders, and trace reading reduce overfitting.
- Autonomous task reliability declines with task horizon and varies sharply by task. Plans must
  bound work and checkpoint progress instead of extrapolating short-task success.
- Indirect prompt injection should be evaluated as attacker-controlled sources reaching dangerous
  sinks. Instruction filtering alone is weak; permissions, sandboxing, network/data-flow policy,
  confirmations, telemetry, and end-to-end adversarial trials form the practical defense.

## Interpretation

The sources converge on a shift from prompt craft to harness engineering. devgod therefore treats
the PRD, goal, prompt, tools, state machine, checkpoint, graders, and evidence as one versioned
execution contract. This is an engineering inference, not a claim made verbatim by one source.
