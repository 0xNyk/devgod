# Anti-slop and deliberation research - July 2026

## unmachined findings adopted

The local repository at `https://github.com/0xNyk/unmachined` was inspected at commit
`26f3fdfb50c659ed6ef4c0d110a41bf11bb340ef` (2026-07-14). devgod adopts these parts:

- Write under the rules from the start; do not generate filler and clean it afterward.
- Deterministic severity-tiered text and UI checks before model self-review.
- Truth preservation for facts, numbers, identifiers, quotations, units, URLs, and scope.
- Variety across outputs so a fixed anti-default style does not become a second monoculture.
- Separate text and rendered-interface checks, with accessibility and browser evidence retained.
- Always-on configuration for human-facing output and explicit disclosure when scanning is absent.

devgod does not use unmachined as an authorship detector. Research on stylometric classification
shows measurable signals, but performance depends on genre, passage length, model, language, and
editing. Short samples can produce false positives. The safe use is linting artifacts you control,
not accusing authors or making disciplinary decisions.

## Council findings adopted

The local repository at `https://github.com/0xNyk/council-of-high-intelligence` was inspected at
commit `83e2dd39a1b0cdd6c4455b62af23ed37bed2948b` (2026-07-14). devgod adopts the protocol where it
improves engineering judgment:

- A problem-restatement gate before analysis.
- Independent blind-first positions followed by anonymized cross-review.
- Diversity of reasoning methods and, when available, model families.
- Anti-conformity prompts, dissent quotas, counterfactuals, and bounded rounds.
- An independent synthesizer, explicit vote accounting, minority report, unresolved questions,
  acceptable compromises, kill criteria, and a single owned next action.
- Honest no-consensus outcomes when the evidence does not support a winner.

devgod does not copy the 18 personas, provider router, or full protocol into routine work. Research
on multi-agent debate is conditional: diversity can help, but debate can also amplify conformity,
self-confidence, correlated errors, and cost. Deliberation must beat a strong single-agent or
deterministic baseline on a task-relevant eval before becoming the default.

  anti-conformity, independent chair, and decision receipts.

## devgod design decision

unmachined is a default human-facing output gate because it is cheap, deterministic, and catches
known defects without adding model calls. Council remains optional because its benefit depends on
decision ambiguity and method/model diversity, while its cost grows with seats and rounds. Both
compose through explicit boundaries so devgod remains its own standalone engineering skill.
