# devgod gap audit

**Date**: 2026-08-23 · **Skill version**: 1.90.0
**Purpose**: Coverage vs a production fullstack SaaS OS - filled, thin, deferred, and missed.
**Companion**: [deep-2026-07.md](deep-2026-07.md) · [report.md](report.md) · [python/](python/)
**Loop/AI eng synthesis**: distilled into `references/workflows.md`, `references/agentic-engineering.md`, and `external-agent-methods-2026-07.md` (source pack was a private workspace repo, not vendored)
**Partner reference**: gstack to `references/composition.md`
**Deep research**: Weizhena-style pipeline in `references/deep-research.md` (v1.6)

Gaps: strong · thin (exists but incomplete) · deferred · missing

---

## Executive snapshot (current)

Live inventory (1.90.0): **51** slash commands, **208** eval scenarios, **109**
reference modules + MANIFEST, **100** scripts. SKILL.md is a router (under 500 lines).
`design-taste.md` is the aesthetic contract; `--design` scan flags measured 2026 tells.
Skill-eval hash-chain rebind is a local health fixture, not only CI.

2026-08 refresh: Next 16 + `proxy.ts` + Cache Components is the greenfield default;
MCP pins **2026-07-28**; Stripe default is Checkout Sessions; Agent Skills spec
fields `license` / description limits are enforced; operator X-article runbooks
are gated out of this repo.

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill router / progressive disclosure** | strong | L2 restored; design-motion and long-horizon are at-need, not default verb loads |
| **Stack pins** | strong | COMPAT 2026-08-19: Next 16.x LTS, React 19.2, Tailwind v4 `@source`, `proxy.ts` |
| **MCP authorization and runtime evidence** | strong | Spec pin 2026-07-28; OAuth/OIDC, PKCE S256, streamless elicitation, captured-call validator; Tasks remain an opt-in extension |
| **Outer-loop / risk gates / maker-checker** | strong | `workflows.md` + `/devgod-loop-agent` |
| **AI boundary / security / evals / pgvector** | strong | ai-* + `backend-pgvector` |
| **FTS / admin / metered / flags / motion** | strong | modules shipped 2026-07-14 cycles |
| **Onboarding empty states + checklist** | strong | `product-onboarding.md` deepened |
| **Eval specification CI** | strong | validate.yml + 208 structurally checked scenarios |
| **Cross-domain expert-depth contract** | strong | project truth, governing sources, characteristic failures, native artifacts, same-layer proof, and explicit unknowns |
| **Goal-to-runtime system assurance** | strong | product truth model, business-rule and journey traceability, layered full-stack tests, first-divergence debugging, production evidence, and residual-risk boundary |
| **Visual communication and distribution assets** | strong | question-based infographic taxonomy; truthful blueprints/field notes; X/blog, thumbnail, identity, watermark, GitHub and banner contracts; crop, accessibility, provenance and measurement gates |
| **Implementation completeness** | strong | production-by-default scope, ambiguity gates, anti-mock/placeholder/defer sweep, real-boundary evidence, and honest partial/blocked states |
| **Root-cause fix engineering** | strong | fix-site diagnosis contract, symptom-patch prohibition, declared-mitigation protocol, fix-time architecture gates, and mitigated-vs-fixed completion language |
| **Portfolio/workspace context** | strong | declared workspace-truth sources, machine-readable repo→venture resolution, snapshot-not-rescan health, cross-repo impact checklist, hold escalation, facts-not-decisions boundary |
| **Deep-research claim evidence** | strong | claim graph, exact topic set/cutoff, source consistency, and hash-bound independent claim-support review with explicit semantic limits |
| **Research framing and integrity** | strong | Phase 0 charter, claim-relative evidence fitness, coverage/contradiction ledger, time/version checks, degraded states, failure sweep, and reviewer-calibration boundary |
| **Behavioral skill evidence** | strong | captured hash-bound runs, outcome/trajectory graders, calibration and promotion gates |
| **Evidence path identity** | strong | one lexical contract rejects traversal, escape, and final or parent symlinks inside evidence roots; every evidence JSON/JSONL CLI reader preserves and rejects a final supplied symlink before resolution |
| **Evidence publication identity** | strong | immutable receipts use exclusive non-following creation; MCP packages require a new directory; telemetry serializes validated identity-checked appends; regenerable reports remain distinct |
| **Provider-executed private baseline corpus** | capture-ready | sealed Codex/Claude adapters, transaction-marked batch preparation and local telemetry exist; genuine private runs remain manual and out of default CI |
| **Implicit skill activation** | strong | sealed exactly-once activation marker plus a live local runner (`run-live-evals.py`) that drives `claude -p` with probe-token activation detection and a skills-disabled baseline arm with measured lift; provider-executed cross-host captures remain manual |
| **Anti-overengineering / proportional architecture** | strong | schema-v2 plan complexity receipt binds present evidence, simplest design, abstractions/components, SOLID pressure, reversibility and rejected options |
| **Verified commit and deployment provenance** | strong | local-vs-GitHub signature semantics, co-author limits, native signed-commit ruleset, exact-SHA fail-closed deploy gate |
| **CSP reporting and promotion** | strong | modern/legacy bounded ingest, privacy minimization, poison resistance, Report-Only-to-enforce decision gate |
| **OSS maintainer operations** | strong | automatic public-repo mode, proportional audit, documented-ecosystem dependency updates with ambiguity evidence, independently replayed schema-v2 receipt, community/governance/security/release/sustainability contract |
| **Devgod evaluation telemetry** | strong | opt-in local metadata-only ledger, validator, summary, privacy gates, optional OTel boundary |
| **Skill and executable-guidance supply chain** | strong | semantic admission, source-class routing, catalog non-transitivity, and syntax-aware docs/workflow gate |
| **Capability-to-skill promotion** | strong | automatic detection plus a replayable ownership receipt and captured signal/catalog/authority/decision-review bindings covering collision, lifecycle, behavioral evidence, install, and retirement |
| **Third-party skill trust receipts** | strong | full tree/provenance/behavior/reviewer decision validator and adversarial fixtures |
| **Multi-agent runtime governance** | strong | contract plus captured-run proof for delegation, lanes, budgets, joins, traces, cancellation, synthesis |
| **Rate-limit template** | strong | `templates/lib/rate-limit.ts` + scan |
| **Portage handoff recipe** | strong | `composition.md` |
| **Trajectory / multi-turn evals** | strong | contract-bound ordered state machine covers observations, evidence, state, planned completion, fresh checkpoints, stop semantics, tool/security policy, and direct input identity; hosted trace exploration remains optional |
| **Acceptance completion proof** | strong | contract-defined JSON oracles, hash-bound captured evidence, exact command coverage, and independent completion review |
| **Prompt/loop optimization proof** | strong | exact captured-trial derivation, paired seeds, counterbalanced order, blinded grading, holdout isolation, and captured-only promotion |
| **Optimization evidence provenance** | strong | cryptographic artifact subject and trusted GitHub workflow/source policy; private-repo entitlement remains deployment-specific |
| **Optimization change attribution** | strong | exact hash-bound baseline/candidate configs and deterministic one-path structural diff across all agent layers |
| **Optimization runtime identity binding** | strong | captured trials carry derived whole-variant and per-layer hashes; stale, swapped, missing, or forged bindings fail |
| **Deep research (outlinetodeeptoreport)** | strong | `deep-research.md` + templates + scripts |
| **Browser QA + parallel Playwright** | strong | executable public/quality/auth-read lanes plus guarded iPhone and 320px reflow/zoom gates; standard excludes shared writes; explicit auth-write is credentialed single-worker serial |
| **Browser-agent security receipts** | strong | exact origins, ephemeral auth, URL/data sinks, injection, transfers, permissions, cleanup, evidence |
| **Cross-lane browser evidence** | strong | canonical per-session validation plus account/tenant/worker/namespace uniqueness, overlap, concurrency, artifact-root, cleanup, and review proof |
| **Executable browser-agent guard** | strong | Playwright request blocking, secret-URL checks, popup/download/dialog/error evidence |
| **Durable agent-memory governance** | strong | admission/retrieval/lifecycle receipt; provenance, tenant/subject, contradiction, expiry, deletion-resurrection gates |
| **Cross-CLI coordination transport boundary** | strong | transport-neutral untrusted pointer contract; optional llmquota ring adapter without collector/runtime duplication |
| **Coordination delivery evidence** | strong | executable valid-contract/delegation/artifact output-schema binding with chronology, replay, expiry, acknowledgment, and independent-review gates |
| **Behavioral design** | strong | ethical choice architecture + dark-pattern hard gates |
| **Product marketing / GTM engineering** | strong | launch surfaces, attribution, PQL, CRM feedback |
| **SEO / SEA / AI discovery engineering** | strong | standards-status-aware crawl/index, AI crawler, llms.txt experiment, paid landing, consent, conversion, and retained-revenue gates |
| **Product analytics / KPI contracts** | strong | metric/event/experiment/data-quality contracts |
| **Product-business engineering** | strong | goals to revenue software; standalone scope boundary |

## Changelog of this audit

### v1.4.0 research deepen (2026-07-13)

| Change | Detail |
|---|---|
| Expanded | `security-research.md` stub to full threat model corpus |
| Added | `deep-2026-07.md` multi-domain deepen + misses |
| Rewrote | this gap-audit for 1.4.0 matrix |
| Identified P0 | jobs, multitenant, OTel template, Playwright template, rate-limit enforce, footers |
| Confirmed strong | design, RSC, RLS basics, Stripe path, enforcement, refactor progressive disclosure |

### Prior (retained)

- v1.3.1 OSS prep, commands, workflows
- v1.2 MANIFEST, skill-authoring, human docs
- v1.1 i18n, storage, flags, compliance, monorepo
- v1.0 security module, billing, deploy, obs, seo, email, onboarding

---

## Research footer compliance

| Status | Modules |
|---|---|
| Has research link | All `references/*` leaves + hubs (2026-07-13) |
| Prefer specific domain links | Hubs still point at domain corpora; leaves point at report/deep/gap |

Do **not** bulk-load research in sessions - footer is progressive disclosure only.

---

## Decision rule (unchanged)

Add or expand a module when:

1. Gap appears in **>=3 real projects**, or
2. Gap is **ship-blocking** for the default stack (Next + Supabase SaaS).

P0 rows above meet (2) for typical B2B. Do not bloat SKILL.md - new modules stay L3 references.

---

## Skill compliance

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| SKILL.md progressive disclosure / thin router | done 1.86.0 (license field; operator L2 dump rejected) |
| Third-person description + negative triggers | done |
| MANIFEST canonical catalog | done |
| Evals present | done |
| Human docs separated | done |
| Research not bulk-loaded | done footers point on-demand |
| Security research non-stub | done as of this pass |

---

## Maintenance

- Re-run gap audit every **6 months** or on Next / Supabase / MCP major. Last pass: 2026-08-23 (1.90.0).
- After material capability additions, bump the skill minor, evals, MANIFEST, docs, and CHANGELOG together; `validate-repo.sh` guards drift.
- Keep deep corpus dated; retire stale claims with strikethrough + date.
