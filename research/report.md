**Date**: 2026-07-16 · **Version**: 1.71.0
**Human docs**: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) · **Audit**: [gap-audit.md](gap-audit.md) · **Deepen**: [deep-2026-07.md](deep-2026-07.md) · **Python**: [python/](python/)

## Executive summary

devgod is a **router skill** composing specialist modules. Rules are grounded in
**2026 web research** (WCAG 2.2, DTCG tokens, Supabase/Next docs, PLG funnels,
Stripe webhooks, OTel, job runners), not a single-project aesthetic reference.

| Layer | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Agent router | `SKILL.md` | Verbs, routing, flows, hard gates |
| Human docs | `docs/` | Install, verbs, CI setup, module map |
| Reference modules | `references/*.md` | Domain rules (agent, on demand) |
| Research | `research/*.md` | Provenance (via module footers only) |
| Enforcement | `scripts/`, `templates/` | Policy-as-code |
| Copy quality | unmachined | Anti-slop audits |
| Ship | gstack | qa, cso, ship |

**1.66.9** adds capability promotion: DevGod detects evidence-backed recurring workflows, chooses
the smallest durable owner, and invokes `skill-creator` only after a new or changed skill beats
project code, repository instructions, DevGod, and installed-skill reuse.

**1.66.10** makes that ownership decision replayable. A canonical receipt derives recurrence or
consequence qualification, complete owner comparison, router/evidence sufficiency, skill-creator and
evaluation coverage, destination authority, independent review, lifecycle ownership, and
new-skill non-duplication.

**1.66.11** closes captured-label forgery: a captured ownership claim now replays exact signal,
catalog, authority, and canonical-decision review artifacts through confined hash-bound paths.

**1.66.14** adds executable mobile-web quality: the Playwright pack now runs a guarded iPhone lane
and a 320px compact lane that detect page overflow, missing device-width metadata, disabled zoom,
and maximum zoom below 200%, while keeping real-device limitations explicit.

**1.66.15** updates MCP admission to the latest stable 2025-11-25 contract: ordered OAuth/OIDC
discovery, Client ID Metadata security, verified PKCE S256, scope step-up, and mode-specific
elicitation controls are now replayable; experimental Tasks remain quarantined.

**1.66.16** promotes expert pushback into a top-level operating principle. DevGod separates the
user's desired outcome from a proposed method, resists instructions to suppress evidence-backed
challenge, and continues safe work around the smallest supported alternative instead of stopping at
criticism.

It also adds goal-to-runtime system assurance: accepted product goals, roles, state transitions,
business invariants, and critical journeys map to focused frontend/backend tests, contract and
permission checks, browser journeys, failure recovery, correlated runtime signals, and explicit
residual risk. Universal "100% functional" claims are rejected unless the contract is closed and
finite.

**1.66.17** adds a cross-surface visual-communication system. It chooses infographics by the
reader's question, treats blueprints and field notes as evidence-bearing editorial forms, and gives
X/blog visuals, YouTube thumbnails, logos, watermarks, GitHub previews, and channel banners distinct
composition, crop, accessibility, provenance, export, and measurement contracts.

**1.66.18** makes production completeness the default: ambiguity cannot silently reduce scope, test
doubles stay confined to explicit/test contexts, and TODOs, fake success, skipped checks, dead UI,
hidden unfinished branches, or "for now" deferrals block completion in affected production scope.

**1.66.19** adds whole-company operating-system context without duplicating the private strategy skill. DevGod can now
map executive and functional accountability, human-relations safeguards, governance, finance,
marketing, sales, security, legal operations, controls, evidence, exceptions, appeals, integration,
and assurance while reserving strategy, people decisions, capital allocation, and professional legal
or accounting judgment to accountable humans.

**1.70.0** adds the two security boundary modules below the app layer. `infra-security.md`
owns cloud IAM least privilege, network exposure discipline, SSH/VPS hardening for
an RPC edge-node venture, OrbStack container hardening, production secrets stores, and backup/DR
security, scoped to the stack actually in use (K8s-at-scale and hyperscaler org policy stay
explicitly out of scope). `compliance-controls.md` maps SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR themes onto
existing modules and gates, classifies controls met-by-evidence / met-by-policy / gap into an
owned controls register, and treats retained receipts and audit events as compliance
evidence — while never claiming compliance status; certification and legal questions route to
company-operating-system governance and human counsel.

**1.71.0** adds `long-horizon-agents.md`, distilled from the 12-item private
`agent-longevity-research` corpus: the empirically grounded session-degradation model (context
rot, lost-in-the-middle, multi-turn drift, self-conditioning, compaction loss), phase context
budgets and the fan-out-vs-single-thread boundary, the externalized-state spine contract
(conversation is cache, files are truth), compact/restart/handoff hygiene, ongoing/cron
fresh-context run patterns with snapshot + append-only journal state, and degradation detection
signals with a recovery protocol. Research notes: `long-horizon-agents-2026-07.md`.

**1.69.0** closes the eval-harness live-runner gap: a stdlib-only runner drives Claude Code
headless print mode against a curated `evals/live-smoke.json` subset, detects real routing
through the sealed `[routing-probe:alpha]` → activation-marker contract, grades assert/forbid
substrings, and compares a with-skill arm against a `--disable-slash-commands` baseline arm
with strict and content-only lift. Opt-in only (`run-evals.sh --live`); default CI stays
model-free with a shimmed-host fixture. First measured finding: advisory-form fix prompts get
correct root-cause behavior without a Skill-tool body load (tracked as a `known_gap` xfail),
while build-shaped prompts load the body and emit the sealed marker.

**1.68.1** optimizes the token economy: the L1 description gains sibling negative triggers
(unmachined, gstack, vercel react-best-practices) inside the 1024-char budget, and
`enforcement.md` splits structure-only into setup/orientation plus an `enforcement-rules.md`
catalog with every rule preserved verbatim and inbound references re-pointed.

**1.68.0** adds ambient portfolio context: project detection reads workspace registry, global
agent policy, and the control plane's machine-readable policy and health snapshot (never
rescanning), resolves repo→venture through the declared mapping with "unknown — ask" fallback,
runs a cross-repo impact checklist, and escalates founder holds, disabled automation, and
unhealthy workspaces. DevGod loads portfolio facts; portfolio decisions stay with the private strategy skill.

**1.67.0** makes root cause a diagnosis obligation for every fix: reproduce, name the violated
invariant, trace the causal chain to the first divergence, and repair there. Symptom patches
(retry masking a race, null guard hiding a broken invariant, widened timeout hiding an N+1) are
defects; symptom-level mitigations ship only declared, with owner, expiry, tracked follow-up,
and detection, and reports distinguish "mitigated" from "root-cause fixed."

**1.66.20** strengthens deep research after a pinned, read-only comparison with
`Imbad0202/academic-research-skills`. It adds a research charter, claim-relative source fitness,
coverage and contradiction ledgers, time/version consistency, explicit degraded states, a research
integrity sweep, and calibration requirements before a model semantic reviewer becomes a hard gate.

**1.66.13** makes evidence-backed expert pushback binding: DevGod challenges consequential flawed
premises, researches uncertain or drifting decisive claims, proposes the smallest better path, and
distinguishes user-owned tradeoffs from non-negotiable safety and authority gates.

**1.66.12** hardens multi-turn completion paths: success requires observed evidence and state,
planned completion, fresh state-matching checkpoints, and exactly one final declared stop.

**2026-07-15 deepen**: browser QA lanes, parallel-safe Playwright, behavioral
design, product marketing, GTM engineering, product analytics/KPI, and
product-business engineering. devgod remains a standalone product-engineering skill.

## Prior notes (stack + backend)

See sections below for Next.js 16 cache, Supabase SSR, shadcn, and agent skill
landscape research from initial build.

Differentiator vs existing skills: devgod adds **design system + a11y + patterns**
as first-class modules alongside TypeScript/Rust/API flows.

---

## 1. Design & frontend (web research)

**Design corpus**: `research/design-research.md`
**Frontend corpus**: `research/frontend-research.md`
**Backend corpus**: `research/backend-research.md`

Key 2026 standards encoded in devgod:
- Three-tier design tokens (primitive → semantic → component)
- WCAG 2.2 AA at component source (not overlay widgets)
- 8pt grid + 12-column layout + mobile-first breakpoints
- Form UX: labels above, on-blur validation, field-level errors
- Dashboard UX: F-pattern, one task per screen, defaults not empty
- shadcn: wrapper pattern, OKLCH tokens, `@theme inline`
- RSC default; client islands at leaves
- Core Web Vitals: LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1 (field data)
- State: URL → Server/RSC → Query → Zustand (UI only)
- Granular Suspense; skeletons with fixed dimensions
- Testing: Vitest + RTL + Playwright (5-15 E2E flows)
- RLS on all public tables; `(select auth.uid())` in policies
- Server Actions = public endpoints; auth + Zod + rate limit
- `updateTag` in Actions; `revalidateTag` in Route Handlers
- Webhook signature verify + idempotency on event ID

---

## 2. Next.js 16 / App Router (docs + GitHub)

**Sources**: nextjs.org/docs (cacheComponents, caching), Vercel Academy,
GitHub vercel/next.js#89375, noqta.tn cache guide

### Key shifts (2026)

- **Dynamic by default**; caching is opt-in via `'use cache'`
- **PPR is default** with `cacheComponents: true`: static shell + streamed dynamic holes
- **`use cache` placement**: on data functions / leaf components, NOT page orchestrators
- **Invalidation split**:
  - `updateTag()`: read-your-own-writes (Server Actions)
  - `revalidateTag(tag, profile)`: stale-while-revalidate background refresh
- **Never** `cookies()`/`headers()` inside `use cache` scope
- **Suspense** for user-specific dynamic content; don't wrap entire `<body>`

### Encode in devgod

Add to `data-layer.md` and `stack-rules.md`:
- Explicit cacheLife on every `use cache`
- Cache tag registry pattern for growing apps
- `connection()` only for whole-page dynamic; prefer Suspense + cache elsewhere

---

## 3. Tailwind v4 / design tokens (docs)

**Sources**: tailwindcss.com/docs/theme, llmbestpractices.com/tailwind-theme,
DesignDev.io token system, DEV raxxostudios

### Two-layer token model (recommended)

```css
:root {
  --accent: #c5f23f;
  --bg: #08090a;
}

@theme inline {
  --color-accent: var(--accent);
  --color-bg: var(--bg);
}
```

- **Static tokens** in `@theme` (spacing, fonts, shadows)
- **Themeable tokens** via `@theme inline` + `:root` / `.dark` overrides
- **Namespace prefixes are load-bearing**: `--color-*`, `--radius-*`, `--font-*`
- **OKLCH** for new projects; `color-mix()` for derived tints is also valid
- **CI grep**: fail build on `@theme` vars missing known namespace prefix

### shadcn + Tailwind v4

- Theme at token layer in `globals.css`, not in component files
- Wrapper pattern for structural changes (never edit `components/ui/*`)
- Product abstractions: `AppButton`, `AppDialog` wrapping shadcn primitives
- CVA for variants; `cn()` for merge
- OKLCH cssVars in shadcn init is 2026 best practice (llmbestpractices, eastondev)

---

## 4. Supabase + Next.js (docs + GitHub)

**Sources**: supabase.com/docs (SSR client), supabase/ssr, supabase/server,
SecureStartKit 2026 guide, DEV Community RLS guide

### Auth architecture (2026)

1. **Middleware**: refresh tokens; MUST implement `getAll` + `setAll`
2. **Middleware protection**: prefer `getClaims()` (JWT verify locally)
3. **Server Components/Actions**: use `getUser()` (DB-validated)
4. **Never** trust `getSession()` alone on server
5. **Never** expose service role; admin client server-only with comments

### RLS

- Enable on every `public` table, with no exceptions
- Separate INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE policies
- Test with `SET ROLE` in SQL before deploy
- Server client resolves `auth.uid()` via cookies; anon client will not

### New note: `@supabase/server` (2026)

Composable with `@supabase/ssr`:
- ssr = cookie lifecycle
- server = JWT verify, RLS-scoped context client, admin client

devgod should mention this for advanced setups but default to `@supabase/ssr`.

---

## 5. Conversion / SaaS landing (web research)

**Sources**: vezadigital.com 2026 patterns, saasframe.io trends, saasdesign.io

### High-converting structure (2026)

1. **One objective per page**: remove nav on pure landing when possible
2. **5th-7th grade reading level**: outcome language, not feature dumps
3. **Product-first hero**: real screenshots/terminal > abstract 3D
4. **Bento grids**: modular feature scan for multi-capability products
5. **Sticky primary CTA**: after scroll past hero
6. **Minimal signup friction**: defer profile fields post-auth
7. **Social proof with attribution**: name, role, company
8. **Typography personality**: neutral-only type is declining; contrast pairs OK

### Config-driven marketing patterns

- Central `site.ts` for copy/CTAs/links
- `lastUpdated` for freshness signals (sitemap, JSON-LD)
- Placeholder metrics with distinct styling, never invented
- Featured pricing tier with clear visual hierarchy

---

## 6. Existing agent skills landscape (GitHub)

| Repo | Strength | Gap devgod fills |
|---|---|---|
| vercel-labs/agent-skills | React perf (40+ rules) | No design system, a11y, conversion |
| jeffallan/claude-skills/nextjs-developer | App Router modules | Generic UI doctrine |
| enesdmc0/ai-skills | Supabase + Next auto-trigger | No design/accessibility modules |
| sateeshs/cc-nextjs (SSD) | Drizzle + shadcn scaffolding | No design patterns |
| Nembie/claude-code-skills | Route generators, reviewers | No WCAG/pattern encoding |
| unmachined (local) | Anti-slop copy + design tells | Does not build; audits |
| private strategy skill (local) | Business strategy router | Not engineering |

**devgod positioning**: Fullstack builder with **web-researched design system +
a11y + patterns** + TypeScript/Rust/API flows, composing unmachined + vercel
react-best-practices + gstack.
